Efficacy of Air Pollution Policymaking 
The goal of this paper was to quantify the quality of air in salt lake county over 20 years. Then to understand the effect certain Clean Air Act policies have on that air quality. 

Decreasing air quality is a pressing
issue for many large cities across the globe.
In addition to irritating eyes, lungs, and
throats of habitants, poor air quality can
cause lasting conditions such as asthma
and other respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases. In the US alone poor air quality
contributes to more than 100,000 premature
deaths each year.
Salt Lake City is consistently among
the worst cities in the world for air quality.
This is in part due to its unique geographical
location, as well as high wildfire risk. While
topology cannot be changed, strict fire
regulation can allow mitigation of airborne
particulates into already polluted air. With
airborne particulates being a rising concern
across the nation, the federal government
has made efforts to curb the use of pollution
since the 1960s. Additionally, the State of
Utah has made increasing efforts to protect
its own air in recent years with State laws
and ordinances specific to the mountain
west.
The purpose of this paper is to
analyze how Utah’s state regulations in
recent years have affected the air quality
index (AQI) in the state. To do this, I will use
a difference in difference model comparing
Utah’s AQI to surrounding states’ over time.
Utah State rule R307 (effective 1998) will
serve as the treatment with surrounding
states as the control. R307 expands on
federal law by further regulating natural gas
flaring, prescribed burning, factory
emissions, and more. Data is collected from
the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) database. The publicly
available datasets provide county level
annual AQI data for each state. The 7 years
prior to the bill's introduction (1990-1997)
will compare the states before the regulation
is put into action, and the 7 years after
(1999-2006) will help determine the effect
the bill has had post implementation.
